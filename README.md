### [Types of Graph Neural Networks Tasks](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/comprehensive-introduction-graph-neural-networks-gnns-tutorial)
- Graph Classification: we use this to classify graphs into various categories. Its applications are social network analysis and text classification. 
- Node Classification: this task uses neighboring node labels to predict missing node labels in a graph. 
- Link Prediction: predicts the link between a pair of nodes in a graph with an incomplete adjacency matrix. It is commonly used for social networks. 
- Community Detection: divides nodes into various clusters based on edge structure. It learns from edge weights, and distance and graph objects similarly. 
- Graph Embedding: maps graphs into vectors, preserving the relevant information on nodes, edges, and structure.
- Graph Generation: learns from sample graph distribution to generate a new but similar graph structure.
